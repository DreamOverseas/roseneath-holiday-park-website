  "aboutUs.imageAlt": "Roseneath Caravan Park",
  "aboutUs.section1.paragraph1": "35 years ago, Grant and Karin Heeley transformed a quiet farm into a two-site caravan park, marking the beginning of an exciting journey.",
  "aboutUs.section1.paragraph2": "In the 1980s, the Lewis family expanded the campsite to 50 sites, welcoming more travelers to settle in and enjoy the beauty of nature. Subsequently, Grant and Karin Heeley took over the management of the campsite. Under their dedicated stewardship, the campsite was further expanded to 100 sites, with improved facilities that attracted even more outdoor enthusiasts to explore this beautiful land.",
  "aboutUs.section1.paragraph3": "In 2020, outdoor enthusiasts Danni and Kin Zhuo arrived with their family for a short stay. However, due to the pandemic lockdown, they found themselves unexpectedly 'stuck' at the campsite. Over time, they fell in love with this land, chose to stay, welcomed two beautiful children, and introduced the spirit of off-road touring across Australia. This led to the creation of the brand 'Little White Touring Australia', giving new life to the campsite.",
  "aboutUs.section1.paragraph4": "Now, the site has been taken over by John Du and Jerry Zhu's Association, who bring with them bold and diverse dreams. With their vision, the campsite has been rebranded as Roseneath Holiday Park! ",
  "aboutUs.activities.paragraph1": "The Roseneath Caravan Park is located in the beautiful, scenic Gippsland area, on the sandy, South East shore of Lake Wellington. This family and pet friendly caravan park offers a real bush experience, being located in the tranquil bushlands of Meerileu.",
  "aboutUs.activities.paragraph2": "Experience fabulous fishing, boating and swimming. Fishing is a lot of fun and good catches of Bream, Mullet, Flathead, and Carp can be had. Fishing on the lake is great from the shore or a boat. Hollands Landing boat ramp is only a short drive from the park.",
  "aboutUs.activities.paragraph3": "You can relax with 2km of sandy, child friendly swimming beach on beautiful Lake Wellington. Enjoy the lake's clean, safe swimming conditions, which are ideal for yachting, canoeing, kayaking, jet skiing, and boating. Or take a long, lazy stroll along one of our many walking tracks or along the water's edge. You can also bring your pushbikes and enjoy one of the many bike tracks. The park is pet friendly and ponies and horses have a large paddock with clean water if you wish to bring them along and saddle up for some excellent trail riding.",
  "aboutUs.activities.paragraph4": "Get back to nature with some native flora and fauna spotting. Abundant wildlife includes rare Sea Eagles, Wedge Tail Eagles, friendly Parrots, and Rosellas. Wombats, Kangaroos, Wallabies, Rabbits, and Echidnas are easily found and large bush possums are everywhere and are easily hand-fed and friendly. Groups of Hog Deer are seen occasionally as they are fairly timid.",
  "aboutUs.activities.paragraph5": "We are located between Bairnsdale and Sale. The Park is set on 174 acres of peaceful bushland, including Banksia, Red Gum, White Gum, and ancient River Gum forest. The Park offers both powered and unpowered sites, a communal lounge, separate accommodation, modern toilet facilities, sheltered BBQs as well as a camp kitchen. The park also offers a swimming pool and tennis court.",
